Based on the image above, in Zarc, the calendar is displayed at 10-day intervals. It shows the danger level of growing a particular seed on that date.

## Goals of the Algorithm
1. Organize and concatenate files in different folders in the file *juntar_arquivos.py*
2. Apply an algorithm that converts decimal periods to specific dates in the file *processamento.py*
